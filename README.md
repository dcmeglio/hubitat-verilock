# hubitat-verilock
Provides the ability to add Andersen Verilock devices to Hubitat using the Andersen Verilock Translator to integrate with Z-Wave. These devices allow you to check the open/close as well as locked/unlocked status of Andersen windows.
 
## Devices
Two device drivers are included, one for the Translator and a child device for each sensor.

## Configuration
After pairing your Verilock Translator, open and close a window. A child device will be automatically created for that sensor. It's recommended that you do this process one at a time so that you can assign a meaningful name to each sensor before adding them all.
